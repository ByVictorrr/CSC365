(c) Mapping challenges:
For the Pitching csv files, at first I only saw integer and string types.
When I went in to fill the table it gave me an error because BAOpp is a float.

(d)Three non-trival rquests that can be answered using the dataset you chose
    (1) Return all playerId's such that a player's era was under 2.0
    (2) Return all the teams such that they had a player who had 25 or more homers in a season
    (3) Return all playerId's that pitched and hit during a year
